# THYVIEW_MOVIE_RECOMMENDATION
------------------------------Objective and Scope of the Project-------------------------------------------------
• Improving the Accuracy of the recommendation system.

• Improve the Quality of the movie Recommendation system. 

• Improving Scalability, enhancing the user experience. 

• The objective of this project is to provide accurate movie recommendations to users. 

• The goal of the project is to improve the quality of movie recommendation system, such as 
accuracy, quality and scalability of system than the pure approaches. 
• To eradicate the overload of the data, recommendation system is used as information filtering 
tool in social networking sites. 
• Hence, there is a huge scope of exploration in this field for improving scalability, accuracy 
and quality of movie recommendation systems. 
• Movie Recommendation system is very powerful and important system. But, due to the 
problems associated with pure Content approach, movie recommendation systems also 
suffers with poor recommendation quality and scalability issues. 

---------------------------------- Methodology for Movie Recommendation--------------------------------------------------
We need to perform preprocessing on the dataset and combine the relevant features into a single 
feature. Later, we need to convert the text from that particular feature into vectors. Later, we need to 
find the similarity between the vectors. Finally, get the recommendations as per the system 
architecture mentioned below. 
1). Collection of Data Sets: Collecting all required data sets from Kaggle website. In this 
project we required a tmdb 5000 movie dataset. 
2).  Data Analysis: Make sure that the collected data sets are correct and analyzing the data 
in the csv files. i.e. checking whether all the column Fields are present in the data sets.  
3). Algorithm: In our project we have use cosine similarity and CountVectorizer. 
4). Training and Testing the model: once the implementation of algorithm is completed . 
we have to train the model to get the result. We have tested it several times the model is 
recommend different set of movies to different users 
5). Improvement in this project: In the later stage we can implement different algorithms 
and methods for better recommendation.
